Certainly! Here is the explanation for Lagrange point L3 in Markdown format:

# Derivation of Lagrange Point L3 Formula

The Lagrange points are positions in space where the gravitational forces of two large bodies, such as the Earth and the Moon, combine in a way that allows a smaller object (like a moonlet) to remain in a stable position relative to the larger bodies. The formula for calculating the distance to Lagrange point L3 in the Earth-Moon system involves setting the gravitational forces and the centripetal force due to the circular orbit equal to each other.

## Gravitational Forces

At the Lagrange point L3, the gravitational forces from the Earth and the Moon add up to provide a net force that is directed toward the Lagrange point. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ F_{\text{gravity, Earth}} = F_{\text{gravity, Moon}} \]

Where:

\[ F_{\text{gravity, Earth}} = \frac{G \cdot M_{\text{earth}} \cdot m_{\text{moonlet}}}{(R_{\text{earth-moon}} + r_{\text{L3}})^2} \]

\[ F_{\text{gravity, Moon}} = \frac{G \cdot M_{\text{moon}} \cdot m_{\text{moonlet}}}{(r_{\text{L3}})^2} \]

## Centripetal Force

For an object in circular orbit at the Lagrange point L3, the centripetal force is provided by the gravitational forces. The centripetal force is given by the formula:

\[ F_{\text{centripetal}} = \frac{m_{\text{moonlet}} \cdot \omega^2 \cdot r_{\text{L3}}}{2} \]

Where:
- \( \omega \) is the angular velocity.
- \( \omega = \sqrt{\frac{G \cdot (M_{\text{moon}} + m_{\text{moonlet}})}{r_{\text{L3}}^3}} \)

## Setting Forces Equal

Setting the gravitational forces equal to the centripetal force and solving for \( r_{\text{L3}} \) gives the Lagrange point L3 distance formula:

\[ \frac{G \cdot M_{\text{earth}} \cdot m_{\text{moonlet}}}{(R_{\text{earth-moon}} + r_{\text{L3}})^2} = \frac{G \cdot M_{\text{moon}} \cdot m_{\text{moonlet}}}{r_{\text{L3}}^2} \]

\[ \frac{1}{(R_{\text{earth-moon}} + r_{\text{L3}})^2} = \frac{M_{\text{earth}}}{M_{\text{moon}}} \cdot \frac{1}{r_{\text{L3}}^2} \]

## Lagrange Point L3 Formula

Solving for \( r_{\text{L3}} \), we get the formula used in the code:

\[ r_{\text{L3}} = -R_{\text{earth-moon}} \cdot \left(\frac{M_{\text{earth}} + m_{\text{moonlet}}}{3 \cdot M_{\text{moon}}}\right)^{1/3} \]

The negative sign in front of \( R_{\text{earth-moon}} \) indicates that Lagrange point L3 is located on the opposite side of the Earth compared to the Moon. This is because Lagrange points L3, L4, and L5 form an equilateral triangle with the Earth and the Moon.
