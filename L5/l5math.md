## Derivation of Lagrange Point L5 Coordinates

### Assumptions and Definitions:
- \(M_{\text{earth}}\) and \(M_{\text{moon}}\) are the masses of Earth and the Moon, respectively.
- \(R_{\text{earth-moon}}\) is the distance between the centers of the Earth and the Moon.

### Equilateral Triangle Configuration:
Lagrange points L4 and L5 form an equilateral triangle with the Earth and the Moon. 

### Coordinate System:
Let's set up a coordinate system with the origin at the center of mass between the Earth and the Moon, and the x-axis pointing from the Earth to the Moon.

### Position of Lagrange Point L5:
L5 is located in the third quadrant (negative x and negative y) of the coordinate system.

1. **x-Coordinate (\(x_{\text{L5}})\):**
   - L5 is situated along the line connecting the centers of the Earth and the Moon.
   - The x-coordinate of L5 is a distance of \(R_{\text{earth-moon}}/2\) in the negative x-direction.

   \[ x_{\text{L5}} = -\frac{1}{2} R_{\text{earth-moon}} \]

2. **y-Coordinate (\(y_{\text{L5}})\):**
   - L5 is also displaced in the positive y-direction relative to the center of mass.
   - The y-coordinate of L5 is given by \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} R_{\text{earth-moon}}\), forming an equilateral triangle.

   \[ y_{\text{L5}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} R_{\text{earth-moon}} \]

### Solving for the X,Y coordinates of Lagrange Point L5:

1. **Set up the Equilateral Triangle:**
   Lagrange point L5 is located in an equilateral triangle formed by the Earth, Moon, and L5. The side lengths of this triangle are equal to the distance between the Earth and the Moon (\(R_{\text{earth-moon}}\)).

2. **Define Coordinates:**
   Let \(x_{\text{L5}}\) be the x-coordinate of Lagrange point L5, and \(y_{\text{L5}}\) be the y-coordinate.

3. **Position within the Triangle:**
   - \(x_{\text{L5}}\) is half the distance between the Earth and the Moon in the negative x-direction.
   - \(y_{\text{L5}}\) is \(\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) times the distance between the Earth and the Moon in the positive y-direction.

   Mathematically:
   \[ x_{\text{L5}} = -\frac{1}{2} R_{\text{earth-moon}} \]
   \[ y_{\text{L5}} = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2} R_{\text{earth-moon}} \]

4. **Result:**
   The coordinates \((x_{\text{L5}}, y_{\text{L5}})\) represent the location of Lagrange point L5 within the equilateral triangle.
