# Lagrange Points 4 & 5 Dynamic Location with Multiple Moonlet Interactions

## Introduction

### **What are Lagrange Points?**

Lagrange points are special regions in space where the gravitational forces of two large bodies, like the Earth and the Moon, balance out perfectly, allowing smaller objects to maintain stable positions relative to them. Think of them as celestial "sweet spots" where spacecraft can essentially hover without expending much energy.

### **Rationale For Research**

The relationship between various moonlets within an Earth-Moon type system, and the location of its stable Lagrange points is important. Such incidents happen in real life often, such as a nearby flying asteroid, however only for a couple of days. Understanding the role of additional moonlets will help humans prepare for situations when they become a reality. 

Additionally, with NASA having plans to bring people back to the Moon with their Artemis missions, long-term space stations will eventually be kept in orbit around the Moon. Other space agencies such as the China National Space Agency, also have plans to bring people to the moon by 2030, they will aim to set up long-term bases. These space stations can act as moonlets in the Earth-Moon system. 

In such instances, it will be important to find the location of Lagrange points 4 and 5. Understanding how multiple space stations and moonlets affect Lagrange points 4 and 5 will help NASA and other space agencies when sending satellites to these equilibrium and stable regions for long periods of time.

## Abstract

Lagrange Points are points of equilibrium found within a system of two celestial bodies; they are also used as a solution to the three-body problem. 5 of such points exist within the Earth and Moon system, with only 2 of them (Lagrange Points 4 and 5) being stable. Oftentimes in space, moonlets (asteroids, satellites, etc.) fly in orbit and sometimes settle down within the Lagrange Points. It was hypothesized that Lagrange Points 4 and 5 would shift and change location the most when dealing with a pair of moonlets with the most significant mass over 10 years. The dependent variable for this experiment was the location of the Lagrange Points 4 and 5. The independent variable for this experiment was the mass of the moonlets. The study was carried out using gravitational force formulas, a system of ordinary differential equations, and equations of motion. This was all coded into Python using open-source libraries like ‘numpy’, ‘scipy’, ‘matplotlib’, and ‘pandas.’ The hypothesis was supported by the data. The final location of the Lagrange points did not change significantly between the different moonlet pairs (with different masses). However, it was determined that the moonlet pair with the masses 1*1018 kg and 5*1025 kg had the most gravitational pull and effect on the Lagrange Points 4 and 5. The result of this study suggests that moonlets with the largest mass also have a greater gravitational force on the Lagrange Points 4 and 5, and as a result, cause them to shift. The results of this study can be used in future studies, such as examining the location of the Lagrange points with multiple moonlets, with the third dimension (z-axis).
