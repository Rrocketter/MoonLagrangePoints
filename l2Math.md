## Lagrange Point L2 Calculation

The position of Lagrange point L2 is determined by finding a point along the line connecting the two massive bodies (Earth and Moon), beyond the smaller object (Moon). The formula for the distance to Lagrange point L2 is given by:

This formula is derived from the gravitational forces and accelerations acting on the smaller object (Moonlet) due to the Earth and Moon.

## Orbital Parameters at Lagrange Point L2

Once we have the distance to Lagrange point L2 ![img.png](img.png), we can calculate the orbital parameters such as angular velocity ![img_1.png](img_1.png), orbital period, and orbital speed.

### Orbital Period ![img_3.png](img_3.png)

The orbital period ![img_4.png](img_4.png) is computed as the inverse of the angular velocity:

### Orbital Speed ![img_6.png](img_6.png)

The orbital speed ![img_7.png](img_7.png) is given by multiplying the angular velocity ![img_8.png](img_8.png) by the distance to Lagrange point L2 ![img_9.png](img_9.png):

These formulas are based on the principles of orbital mechanics and centripetal acceleration, taking into account the gravitational forces between the Moon, Earth, and the moonlet.

## Derivation of Lagrange Point L2 Formula

The Lagrange points are locations in space where the gravitational forces of two large bodies, such as a planet and its moon, combine in such a way that a smaller object, like a satellite or moonlet, experiences relatively stable gravitational equilibrium with the two larger bodies.

### Gravitational Forces

The gravitational force between the smaller object (moonlet) and the larger bodies (Earth and Moon) is given by Newton's law of gravitation:

![img_13.png](img_13.png)

Here, ![img_14.png](img_14.png) is the mass of the smaller object, and ![img_15.png](img_15.png) is the distance between Earth and Moon.

### Centripetal Force

The centripetal force required to keep the smaller object in orbit around the combined center of mass of Earth and Moon is given by:

![img_16.png](img_16.png)

where ![img_17.png](img_17.png) is the angular velocity and ![img_18.png](img_18.png) is the distance to Lagrange point L2.

### Equilibrium Condition

At Lagrange point L2, the gravitational forces and centripetal force are balanced. Setting the gravitational forces equal to the centripetal force, we get an equation:

Substituting the expressions for gravitational forces and centripetal force, and simplifying, we arrive at the Lagrange point L2 distance formula:

![img_21.png](img_21.png)

This formula represents the distance from the smaller object (moonlet) to Lagrange point L2 in terms of the masses of Earth and Moon and the distance between Earth and Moon.
